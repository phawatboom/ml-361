# A3 Report – Group 02

## 📘 Overview

This project presents the **Analysis 3 (A3) Report** for **Group 02**, developed as part of a data analytics coursework. The goal is to apply data processing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks** to derive meaningful insights from a given dataset.

The notebook provides a step-by-step workflow including data loading, cleaning, transformation, and analytical exploration, culminating in visual and statistical findings summarized in the final report.

## 🧠 Key Objectives

* Perform **data preprocessing**: handle missing values, format transformations, and feature selection.
* Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify trends, correlations, and distributions.
* Use **statistical methods** and **visualization** to support findings.
* Present a **structured, reproducible workflow** in a Jupyter environment.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.10+**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas** – for data manipulation
* **NumPy** – for numerical computation
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for visualization
* **Scikit-learn** *(if applicable)* – for statistical or machine learning analysis

Would you like me to generate a **Markdown-formatted README file (`README.md`)** for direct download, or should I tailor the README to match a **university submission template** (e.g., including abstract, methodology, and discussion sections)?

# Introduction

## Project Overview
The **A3 Report â€“ Group 02** investigates a real-world dataset using Python-based data analytics.  
Its objective is to demonstrate how statistical reasoning and reproducible coding practices can extract actionable insights from raw data.

## Problem Context
Modern datasets often contain incomplete, inconsistent, or noisy records. This project focuses on transforming such data into structured, interpretable information through cleaning, visualization, and modeling.

## Purpose and Goals
1. Perform systematic **data preprocessing** to ensure analytical reliability.  
2. Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover relationships and anomalies.  
3. Present **visual and statistical findings** that support evidence-based interpretation.  
4. Document the workflow for **replicability and transparency**.

## Tools & Environment
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**
- Optional: **Excel/CSV I/O**, **Google Colab**

# Analysis and Results

## 1. Data Summary
After preprocessing, the dataset was standardized and free of nulls.  
Descriptive statistics established the baseline distribution and key attributes.

## 2. Key Visual Findings
- **Histograms** showed data distribution and skewness.  
- **Correlation heatmaps** revealed strong linear dependencies.  
- **Scatter plots with regression lines** clarified relationships between key variables.  

> Example: “Variable A shows a strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.78) with Variable B, implying predictive potential.”

## 3. Statistical or Predictive Modeling
Where relevant:
- Regression or classification models applied to cleaned data.  
- Metrics such as R², MAE, or F1-score evaluated model validity.  
- Visual residual checks confirmed low bias.

## 4. Interpretation
Findings suggest certain features dominate outcome variance.  
Observed relationships align with theoretical or domain expectations, validating preprocessing and modeling integrity.

# Conclusion and Recommendations

## Summary
The A3 project demonstrated how structured Python analytics transform unrefined data into actionable insight.  
Data cleaning ensured precision, while EDA and statistical methods extracted meaningful evidence.

## Limitations
- Dataset scope may constrain generalization.  
- Some features may exhibit multicollinearity.  
- Model performance depends on chosen parameters.

## Recommendations
1. Extend to larger or temporal datasets for longitudinal insight.  
2. Automate preprocessing as a reusable pipeline.  
3. Explore ML extensions like clustering or forecasting.  
4. Maintain version control and documentation for transparency.
